        "issue_details": "The analysis of the PHP file revealed several issues. The first issue is related to the lack of proper input validation which makes the code susceptible to SQL injection attacks. The second issue is the improper use of global variables which can lead to unexpected behavior and make the code hard to debug. The third issue is the lack of error handling mechanisms, making it difficult to identify and fix issues during runtime. The fourth issue is the use of deprecated functions which can lead to compatibility issues with newer versions of PHP. Lastly, the code lacks proper documentation which makes it hard to understand and maintain.",
        "fix_explanation": "To fix these issues, several steps need to be taken. First, all user inputs should be properly validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection attacks. Second, the use of global variables should be minimized and replaced with function parameters or class properties wherever possible. Third, proper error handling mechanisms should be implemented to catch and handle exceptions during runtime. Fourth, deprecated functions should be replaced with their newer counterparts to ensure compatibility with newer versions of PHP. Lastly, the code should be properly documented to make it easier to understand and maintain."
