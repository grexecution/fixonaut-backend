        "issue_details": "The PHP file reviewed has several issues. These include improper use of global variables, lack of proper error handling, inefficient use of loops, and non-compliance with PHP coding standards. There are also instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities due to lack of prepared statements or parameterized queries. Additionally, the code lacks proper comments, making it hard to understand the functionality of certain sections. Lastly, the file has a high level of code duplication, which increases complexity and decreases maintainability.",
        "fix_explanation": "To address these issues, the global variables should be replaced with dependency injection or passed as function parameters to avoid potential conflicts. Error handling should be implemented to ensure the application can gracefully handle unexpected situations. Loops should be optimized to improve performance. The code should be refactored to adhere to PHP coding standards, which will improve readability and maintainability. SQL queries should be rewritten to use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. Comments should be added to explain the functionality of complex code sections. Finally, code duplication should be reduced by extracting common functionality into reusable functions or classes."
