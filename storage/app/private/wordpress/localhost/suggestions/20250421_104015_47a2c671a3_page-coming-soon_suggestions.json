        "issue_details": "The analysis of the PHP file revealed several issues. The most prominent issues include: improper use of global variables, lack of input validation, inefficient database queries, and poor error handling. There were also instances of hard-coded values, which can lead to inflexibility and potential security risks. Additionally, the code lacks proper commenting, making it difficult to understand the logic and flow of the program.",
        "fix_explanation": "To address these issues, a number of steps will be taken. Global variables will be replaced with local variables or passed as function parameters to avoid unwanted side effects. Input validation will be implemented to ensure that all data is correctly formatted and safe to use. Database queries will be optimized for efficiency and to prevent SQL injection attacks. Error handling will be improved to ensure that all potential errors are caught and handled appropriately. Hard-coded values will be replaced with constants or configuration files to increase flexibility and security. Lastly, comments will be added throughout the code to improve readability and maintainability."
