        "issue_details": "The analysis of the PHP file revealed several issues. These include inconsistent coding style, improper use of global variables, and lack of proper error handling. There were also instances of code redundancy, where the same lines of code were repeated in multiple places. Additionally, the file lacked sufficient comments, making it difficult to understand the purpose of certain code blocks. Lastly, there were potential security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection risks due to lack of data sanitization before database queries.",
        "fix_explanation": "The fix approach involves multiple steps. Firstly, the code will be refactored to ensure it adheres to a consistent coding style for better readability and maintenance. The use of global variables will be minimized and replaced with function arguments and return values where possible. Proper error handling mechanisms will be put in place to ensure the application behaves predictably in case of unexpected events. Code redundancy will be eliminated by creating reusable functions. Comments will be added to explain the purpose and functionality of complex code blocks. Lastly, all input data will be properly sanitized before being used in database queries to prevent SQL injection attacks."
