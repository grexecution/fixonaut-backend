        "issue_details": "The analyzed PHP file has several issues. Firstly, there are multiple instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities due to the lack of prepared statements or parameterized queries. Secondly, the file has inconsistent indentation and code formatting, making it difficult to read and understand. Thirdly, there are several deprecated functions being used, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Lastly, there is a lack of error handling mechanisms, which could lead to unhandled exceptions and crashes.",
        "fix_explanation": "To fix these issues, we should start by refactoring the code to use prepared statements or parameterized queries, which will prevent SQL injection attacks. Next, we should apply a consistent code formatting and indentation style across the entire file to improve readability. We should also replace all deprecated functions with their newer alternatives to ensure compatibility with future PHP versions. Finally, we should implement proper error handling mechanisms to catch and handle exceptions, preventing crashes and providing more informative error messages."
