        "issue_details": "The PHP file analysis revealed several issues. These include improper use of global variables, which can lead to data inconsistency and security risks. There were also instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities due to the lack of prepared statements or parameterized queries. In addition, the code contained deprecated PHP functions, which can lead to compatibility issues with newer PHP versions. Lastly, there were several instances of code redundancy, which could be improved for efficiency and maintainability.",
        "fix_explanation": "To address these issues, the global variables should be replaced with local variables or passed as function parameters to ensure data consistency and security. SQL injection vulnerabilities can be mitigated by using prepared statements or parameterized queries. Deprecated functions should be replaced with their newer counterparts to ensure compatibility with newer PHP versions. Code redundancy can be reduced by creating reusable functions or classes. Proper error handling should also be implemented to prevent potential crashes or unexpected behavior."
