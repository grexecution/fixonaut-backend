        "issue_details": "The PHP file analyzed has multiple issues. The main problems include: improper use of global variables, lack of proper input validation, inefficient database queries, and non-compliance with PSR-12 coding standards. The code also lacks proper comments, making it difficult to understand the logic behind some functions. There are also instances of hard-coded values, which makes the code less flexible and harder to maintain. Additionally, there are several deprecated functions used in the code, which may cause compatibility issues with newer versions of PHP.",
        "fix_explanation": "To address these issues, the following steps should be taken: Refactor the code to minimize the use of global variables. Implement proper input validation to prevent SQL injection and other potential security risks. Optimize database queries to improve performance. Follow PSR-12 coding standards to make the code more readable and maintainable. Add comments to explain complex logic and improve code readability. Replace hard-coded values with configuration files or environment variables to make the code more flexible and easier to maintain. Finally, replace deprecated functions with their newer counterparts to ensure compatibility with future versions of PHP."
