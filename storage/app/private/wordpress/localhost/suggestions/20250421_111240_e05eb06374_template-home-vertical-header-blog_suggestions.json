        "issue_details": "The PHP file analysis revealed several issues. Firstly, there were numerous instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities due to the lack of prepared statements or parameterized queries. Secondly, the code lacked proper error handling mechanisms, leaving the application prone to crashes and unexpected behavior. Thirdly, the code contained multiple instances of code duplication, which can lead to maintenance issues and inconsistencies. Lastly, there were several instances of deprecated functions being used, which could lead to compatibility issues with newer versions of PHP.",
        "fix_explanation": "To address the SQL injection vulnerabilities, we will need to refactor the code to use prepared statements or parameterized queries. This will ensure that user-supplied input is always treated as literal values and not executable code. For the lack of error handling, we will introduce try-catch blocks to catch exceptions and handle them gracefully. To address the code duplication, we will identify common functionality and abstract it into reusable functions or classes. Lastly, we will replace the deprecated functions with their newer counterparts to ensure compatibility with newer PHP versions."
