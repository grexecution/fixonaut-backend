        "issue_details": "The PHP file reviewed contains several issues. These include: improper use of global variables, lack of input validation which could lead to security vulnerabilities, inefficient database queries, and non-compliance to PSR-12 coding standards. There are also instances of code duplication and lack of comments for complex code blocks, which can make the code difficult to maintain and understand.",
        "fix_explanation": "To address these issues, the following steps should be taken: Refactor the code to limit the use of global variables. Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent potential security threats like SQL injection. Optimize database queries to improve performance. Adhere to PSR-12 coding standards to ensure code consistency and readability. Remove code duplication by creating reusable functions or classes. Lastly, add comments to complex code blocks to improve code maintainability and understanding for other developers."
