        "issue_details": "The PHP file analyzed has several issues. These include the use of deprecated functions, lack of proper error handling, and poor code organization. There are also instances of hard-coded values, which could lead to potential security risks. Additionally, the file lacks proper comments, making it difficult to understand the logic behind certain sections of the code. There are also some SQL queries that are not properly sanitized, opening up potential for SQL injection attacks. Lastly, the code does not adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, leading to unnecessary repetition of code blocks.",
        "fix_explanation": "The deprecated functions should be replaced with their newer counterparts. Proper error handling should be implemented to ensure that the application can gracefully handle unexpected situations. The code should be organized into functions or classes to improve readability and maintainability. Hard-coded values should be replaced with constants or configuration files. Comments should be added to clarify the purpose and functionality of the code. SQL queries should be sanitized to prevent SQL injection attacks. Lastly, repeated code blocks should be refactored into reusable functions or methods to adhere to the DRY principle."
