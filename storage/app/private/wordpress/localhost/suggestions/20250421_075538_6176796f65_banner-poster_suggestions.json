        "issue_details": "The PHP file reviewed contains several issues. These include: improper use of global variables, lack of proper input validation leading to potential security vulnerabilities, non-compliance with PSR-1 and PSR-2 coding standards, inefficient database queries, and lack of proper error handling. Additionally, the code lacks sufficient comments, making it difficult to understand the functionality of certain sections.",
        "fix_explanation": "To fix these issues, we will need to refactor the code. This will involve: replacing global variables with dependency injection or passing them as parameters, implementing input validation and sanitization to prevent SQL injection attacks, adhering to PSR-1 and PSR-2 coding standards for better readability and maintainability, optimizing database queries to improve performance, and adding comprehensive error handling to prevent application crashes. Furthermore, we will add necessary comments to make the code more understandable."
