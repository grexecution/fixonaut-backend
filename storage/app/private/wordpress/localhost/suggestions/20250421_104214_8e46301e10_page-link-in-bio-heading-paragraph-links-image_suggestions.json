        "issue_details": "The analysis of the PHP file revealed several issues. These include improper use of global variables, lack of input validation, and non-compliance with PSR-1 and PSR-2 coding standards. Additionally, there were instances of hard-coded strings, which could lead to potential localization issues. The file also contained deprecated PHP functions, which could cause compatibility issues with newer versions of PHP. Lastly, there were several instances where error handling was not properly implemented, leaving the application vulnerable to potential crashes or unexpected behavior.",
        "fix_explanation": "To address these issues, the global variables should be replaced with dependency injection or passed as function parameters to improve testability and reduce potential side effects. Input validation should be added where it's missing to prevent potential security vulnerabilities. The code should be refactored to comply with PSR-1 and PSR-2 coding standards to improve readability and maintainability. Hard-coded strings should be replaced with language variables or constants to support localization. Deprecated PHP functions should be replaced with their newer counterparts to ensure compatibility with future PHP versions. Finally, proper error handling should be implemented to prevent application crashes and provide more informative error messages to the users."
