        "issue_details": "The PHP file analyzed has several issues. These include: improper use of global variables, lack of input validation leading to potential SQL injection vulnerabilities, use of deprecated PHP functions, inefficient database queries, and lack of proper error handling. Additionally, the code lacks comments, making it difficult to understand the logic and flow. There are also instances of hard-coded values, which can limit the flexibility of the code.",
        "fix_explanation": "The global variables should be replaced with local ones or passed as function parameters to avoid potential conflicts and improve code maintainability. All inputs should be validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection attacks. Deprecated functions should be replaced with their updated versions. Database queries should be optimized for efficiency, and proper error handling mechanisms should be implemented to improve the robustness of the application. Comments should be added to clarify the purpose and functionality of each code block. Hard-coded values should be replaced with constants or configuration variables to increase code flexibility and adaptability."
