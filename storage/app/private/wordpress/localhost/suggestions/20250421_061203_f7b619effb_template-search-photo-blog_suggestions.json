        "issue_details": "The PHP file review revealed several issues. These include improper use of global variables, lack of input validation, and potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. The code also had poor error handling, and some sections of the code were unnecessarily complex, leading to potential performance issues. There were also instances of hard-coded values, which could lead to maintenance issues in the future.",
        "fix_explanation": "To address these issues, the global variables will be replaced with dependency injection or passed parameters to improve code modularity and testability. Input validation will be added to prevent potential security threats and ensure data integrity. Prepared statements will be used to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. Error handling will be improved by implementing try-catch blocks and appropriate error messages. The complex sections of the code will be refactored to simpler, more efficient alternatives. Lastly, the hard-coded values will be replaced with configuration files or constants to improve maintainability and flexibility of the code."
