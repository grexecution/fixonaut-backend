        "issue_details": "The PHP file reviewed has multiple issues. The first issue is the lack of proper sanitization of user inputs, which could potentially lead to SQL injection attacks. The second issue is the use of deprecated functions, which could lead to compatibility issues with newer versions of PHP. There are also instances of hard-coded values, which makes the code less flexible and harder to maintain. Lastly, there are several sections of the code that are not properly documented, making it difficult to understand the purpose and functionality of the code.",
        "fix_explanation": "To fix the issues identified, the following steps should be taken. First, all user inputs should be properly sanitized using built-in PHP functions to prevent SQL injection attacks. Deprecated functions should be replaced with their newer counterparts to ensure compatibility with newer PHP versions. Hard-coded values should be replaced with variables or constants, and these should be defined in a configuration file or at the top of the script for easy modification. Finally, all sections of the code should be properly documented, including a brief description of what the code does, the parameters it takes, and what it returns. This will make the code easier to understand and maintain."
