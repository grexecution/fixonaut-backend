        "issue_details": "The analysis of the PHP file revealed several issues. The most critical ones include: improper use of global variables, lack of input validation leading to potential security vulnerabilities, inefficient database queries, and non-compliance with PSR-12 coding standards. In addition, there are instances of hard-coded values which could affect the maintainability of the code. Lastly, the code lacks proper commenting, making it difficult to understand the functionality of certain sections.",
        "fix_explanation": "To address these issues, the following approaches are recommended. Firstly, global variables should be replaced with dependency injection or passed as function arguments to ensure better testability and maintainability. Secondly, all user inputs should be validated and sanitized to prevent security threats like SQL Injection and XSS attacks. Thirdly, database queries should be optimized and an ORM could be used to prevent SQL injection attacks. Fourthly, the code should be refactored to comply with PSR-12 coding standards to ensure consistency and readability. Hard-coded values should be replaced with constants or configuration files. Finally, comments should be added to clarify the functionality of complex code sections. This will improve code readability and maintainability."
