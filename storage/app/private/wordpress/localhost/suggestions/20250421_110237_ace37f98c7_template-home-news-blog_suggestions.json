        "issue_details": "The PHP file reviewed has multiple issues. The primary concerns include improper use of global variables, lack of input validation, and poor error handling. There are also instances of hard-coded values, which can lead to difficulties in maintaining the code. Additionally, the code lacks proper comments, making it hard to understand the functionality of certain sections. Lastly, there are several instances of code duplication, which can lead to inconsistencies and bugs in the future.",
        "fix_explanation": "The global variables should be replaced with dependency injection or passed as function parameters to improve testability and reduce the risk of unexpected side effects. Input validation should be added to prevent potential security risks such as SQL injection. Proper error handling should be implemented to provide more informative error messages and handle exceptions gracefully. Hard-coded values should be replaced with constants or configuration values to make the code more maintainable. Adding comments to the code will improve readability and maintainability. Code duplication can be reduced by abstracting common functionality into reusable functions or classes."
