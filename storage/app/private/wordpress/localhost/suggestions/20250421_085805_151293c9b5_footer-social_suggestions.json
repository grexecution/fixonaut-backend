        "issue_details": "The PHP file reviewed contains several issues. These include: improper use of global variables, lack of input sanitization leading to potential SQL injection vulnerabilities, inefficient database queries, and non-compliance with PSR-1 and PSR-2 coding standards. Additionally, there are instances of hard-coded values which should ideally be replaced with constants or configuration values. Finally, there is a lack of proper error handling and logging mechanisms, which makes debugging more difficult.",
        "fix_explanation": "To address these issues, the following steps should be taken: Refactor the code to limit the use of global variables, instead passing necessary data as function parameters. Implement input sanitization and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. Optimize database queries to improve performance. Refactor the code to comply with PSR-1 and PSR-2 standards for better readability and maintainability. Replace hard-coded values with constants or configuration values to make the code more flexible and easier to manage. Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms to facilitate easier debugging and error tracking."
