        "issue_details": "The analysis of the PHP file revealed several issues. The most prevalent issues include: improper use of global variables, lack of input validation leading to potential security vulnerabilities, inefficient database queries, and lack of comments for complex code sections. Additionally, there are instances of code duplication and inconsistent naming conventions. The code also lacks proper error handling and does not adhere to the SOLID principles of object-oriented design.",
        "fix_explanation": "The fix approach will involve several steps. Firstly, we will refactor the global variables to ensure they are used appropriately or replaced with more suitable structures. We will also implement input validation to prevent SQL injection and other security threats. Database queries will be optimized for better performance. We will add necessary comments to improve code readability and maintainability. Code duplication will be reduced by implementing DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. We will also ensure consistent naming conventions to improve code readability. Error handling will be added where missing, and the code will be refactored to adhere to SOLID principles for better structure and future scalability."
