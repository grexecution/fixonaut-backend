        "issue_details": "The analysis of the PHP file revealed several issues. These include improper use of global variables, lack of input validation leading to potential security vulnerabilities, inefficient use of database queries, and non-compliance with PSR-2 coding standards. In addition, there were instances of hard-coded values that should ideally be configurable, and lack of proper error handling and logging mechanisms.",
        "fix_explanation": "To address these issues, the following approach is recommended: Refactor the code to minimize the use of global variables and replace them with dependency injection where possible. Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent SQL injection and other forms of attacks. Optimize database queries and use prepared statements to improve performance and security. Adhere to PSR-2 coding standards for better readability and maintainability. Replace hard-coded values with configuration files or environment variables. Lastly, incorporate robust error handling and logging mechanisms to facilitate easier debugging and issue resolution in the future."
