        "issue_details": "Throughout the PHP file, several issues were identified. These include: improper use of global variables, lack of proper input validation, inefficient database queries, and a lack of proper error handling. Additionally, some parts of the code were not adhering to the PHP coding standards, making it difficult to read and understand.",
        "fix_explanation": "To address these issues, the following approaches will be taken: Global variables will be replaced with function parameters or class properties to reduce the risk of unexpected behavior. Input validation will be implemented to prevent SQL injection and other potential security risks. Database queries will be optimized to improve performance. Proper error handling will be added to ensure that the system can recover gracefully from unexpected situations. Lastly, the code will be refactored to adhere to PHP coding standards, improving readability and maintainability."
