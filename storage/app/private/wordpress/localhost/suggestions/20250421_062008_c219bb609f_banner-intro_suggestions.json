        "issue_details": "The PHP file reviewed has a number of issues. The most prominent ones include: improper use of global variables, lack of input validation and sanitization which makes the code vulnerable to SQL Injection, usage of deprecated PHP functions, poor error handling, and lack of comments for better code understanding. Additionally, there are also instances of hard-coded values, which should ideally be replaced with constants or configuration values. Lastly, the code lacks proper indentation and formatting, making it difficult to read and maintain.",
        "fix_explanation": "To address these issues, the following steps should be taken: First, global variables should be replaced with dependency injection or passed as function parameters to avoid potential conflicts and enhance testability. Second, all inputs should be validated and sanitized before being used in SQL queries to prevent SQL Injection attacks. Deprecated functions should be replaced with their newer counterparts. Proper error handling mechanisms should be implemented to ensure that the application can recover from errors gracefully. Comments should be added for complex logic to improve code readability. Hard-coded values should be replaced with constants or configuration values to make the code more flexible and easier to maintain. Finally, the code should be properly indented and formatted according to the PHP coding standards to improve readability and maintainability."
