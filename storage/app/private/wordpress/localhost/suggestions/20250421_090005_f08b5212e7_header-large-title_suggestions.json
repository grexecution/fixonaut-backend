        "issue_details": "The PHP file reviewed has multiple issues. These include improper use of variables, lack of input sanitization, inefficient use of loops, non-compliance with PSR-2 coding standards, and poor error handling. Additionally, the code lacks adequate comments, making it difficult to understand the logic behind certain operations. There are also instances of hard-coded values, which could lead to potential bugs in the future.",
        "fix_explanation": "The issues identified can be fixed by adhering to best coding practices. Variables should be properly initialized and used. All user inputs should be sanitized to prevent SQL injection attacks. Loops should be optimized for better performance. The code should be refactored to comply with PSR-2 coding standards. Proper error handling mechanisms should be implemented to catch and handle exceptions gracefully. Comments should be added to make the code more readable and maintainable. Hard-coded values should be replaced with constants or configuration values to make the code more flexible and robust."
