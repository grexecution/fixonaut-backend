        "issue_details": "The PHP file reviewed has multiple issues. These include: improper use of global variables, lack of input validation leading to potential security vulnerabilities, inefficient database queries leading to potential performance issues, and non-compliance with PSR-12 coding standards. The code also lacks proper comments, making it difficult to understand the functionality of certain sections. In addition, there are several instances of code duplication, which can lead to maintenance problems in the future.",
        "fix_explanation": "To fix these issues, we need to refactor the code. Global variables should be avoided and replaced with dependency injection or passed as function arguments. All user inputs must be validated and sanitized to prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting. Database queries should be optimized and, where possible, use prepared statements. The code should be refactored to comply with PSR-12 coding standards for better readability and maintainability. Proper comments should be added to the code to explain the functionality of complex sections. Code duplication can be minimized by creating reusable functions or classes."
