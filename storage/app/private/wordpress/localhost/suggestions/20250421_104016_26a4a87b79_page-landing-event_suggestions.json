        "issue_details": "The PHP file analyzed has several issues. The most prominent issue is the lack of proper input validation which could lead to security vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection. There are also instances of deprecated functions being used, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. The file also lacks proper error handling mechanisms, making it difficult to debug or understand the cause of any errors. Lastly, there are several instances of code duplication, which could be refactored for better readability and maintainability.",
        "fix_explanation": "To fix the issues identified, we will need to implement proper input validation to prevent potential security vulnerabilities. This could be achieved by using prepared statements or utilizing PHP's built-in filter functions. For the deprecated functions, we need to replace them with their newer counterparts. Implementing a proper error handling mechanism would involve using try-catch blocks to catch exceptions and handle them appropriately. Lastly, to address the issue of code duplication, we could refactor the code to use functions or classes to encapsulate repeated code blocks."
