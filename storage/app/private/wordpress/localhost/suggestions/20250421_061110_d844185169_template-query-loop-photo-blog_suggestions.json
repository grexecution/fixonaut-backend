        "issue_details": "The PHP file analyzed has multiple issues. These include the use of deprecated functions, lack of proper error handling, and poor coding practices such as the absence of comments for clarity. There are also instances of hard-coded values, which can lead to inflexibility and potential bugs in the future. Additionally, the code lacks proper indentation and formatting, making it difficult to read and understand. Finally, there are several security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection due to the lack of data sanitization and validation before database queries.",
        "fix_explanation": "The deprecated functions should be replaced with their updated counterparts to ensure compatibility with the latest version of PHP. Proper error handling mechanisms should be implemented to prevent the application from crashing unexpectedly. Comments should be added to the code to improve readability and maintainability. Hard-coded values should be replaced with constants or variables, which can be easily modified when needed. The code should be properly indented and formatted for better readability. To address the security issues, user inputs should be properly sanitized and validated before they are used in database queries. Prepared statements or parameterized queries should be used to prevent SQL injection attacks."
