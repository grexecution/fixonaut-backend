        "issue_details": "The analysis of the PHP file revealed several issues. Firstly, there were instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities due to the use of unsanitized user inputs in SQL queries. Secondly, there were several instances of undefined variables being used, leading to potential PHP errors. Thirdly, the code lacked proper error handling mechanisms, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the event of a failure. Lastly, there were several instances where the code was not adhering to PSR-12, the standard PHP coding style guide, leading to inconsistencies in code formatting and readability.",
        "fix_explanation": "To address the SQL injection vulnerabilities, all user inputs should be properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries. This can be achieved by using prepared statements or parameterized queries. For the undefined variables, all variables should be properly initialized before being used. This will prevent potential PHP errors and unexpected behavior. To improve error handling, try-catch blocks should be used to catch exceptions and handle them appropriately. Finally, to improve code readability and maintainability, the code should be refactored to adhere to the PSR-12 coding style guide. This includes proper indentation, use of spaces instead of tabs, and proper naming conventions for variables and functions."
