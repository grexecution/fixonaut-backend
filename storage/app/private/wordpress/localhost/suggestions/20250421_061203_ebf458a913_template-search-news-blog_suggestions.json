        "issue_details": "The analysis of the PHP file revealed several issues. First, there are multiple instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities due to the lack of prepared statements. Second, the code lacks proper error handling mechanisms, which could lead to unexpected behaviors in case of failures. Third, there are several instances of code redundancy, which not only makes the codebase larger but also harder to maintain. Fourth, the code is not adhering to the PSR-2 coding standards, making it less readable and maintainable. Lastly, there are several unused variables and imports, which are unnecessary and can lead to confusion.",
        "fix_explanation": "To address the SQL injection vulnerabilities, all database queries should be converted to use prepared statements or a database abstraction layer that automatically escapes user input. For the lack of error handling, appropriate try-catch blocks should be added around the code that can potentially throw exceptions. Code redundancy can be minimized by creating reusable functions or classes. Adherence to the PSR-2 coding standards can be achieved by refactoring the code according to the guidelines. Unused variables and imports should be removed to clean up the codebase and improve readability."
