        "issue_details": "The analysis of the PHP file revealed several issues. These include improper use of global variables, which can lead to unexpected results due to variable scope. There were also instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities due to the lack of prepared statements or parameterized queries. The code also lacks proper error handling mechanisms, which can lead to unhandled exceptions and crashes. Additionally, the code is not adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, leading to redundancy and making the code harder to maintain. Lastly, the code lacks proper comments, making it difficult to understand the functionality of different sections.",
        "fix_explanation": "To fix these issues, the following steps should be taken. For the issue of global variables, they should be replaced with function parameters or class properties to avoid unexpected side effects. To prevent SQL injection, all database queries should be performed using prepared statements or parameterized queries. Proper error handling mechanisms should be implemented to catch and handle exceptions, preventing crashes and making the code more robust. To adhere to the DRY principle, redundant code should be refactored into functions or methods which can be called multiple times. Finally, comments should be added to the code to clarify the functionality of different sections and make it easier for others to understand."
