        "issue_details": "The analysis of the PHP file revealed several issues. These include: improper use of global variables, lack of proper error handling mechanisms, inefficient use of loops, and non-compliance with PHP coding standards. Additionally, the file contains hard-coded values, which can lead to difficulties in maintenance and scalability. The code also lacks proper comments, making it difficult to understand the logic and purpose of certain code blocks.",
        "fix_explanation": "The global variables should be replaced with local ones, passed as function parameters if necessary. Implementing proper error handling will make the code more robust and prevent unexpected behaviors. Loops should be optimized to improve the performance of the code. Adherence to PHP coding standards will make the code more readable and maintainable. Hard-coded values should be replaced with constants or configuration files. Lastly, adding comments to the code will improve its readability and maintainability, making it easier for other developers to understand the logic and purpose of the code."
