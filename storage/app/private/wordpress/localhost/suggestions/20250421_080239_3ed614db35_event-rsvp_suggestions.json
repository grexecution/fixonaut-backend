        "issue_details": "The analysis of the PHP file revealed several issues. The most significant problems include: improper use of global variables, lack of data validation for user inputs, inefficient database queries, and non-compliance with PSR-12 coding standards. Several instances of hard-coded values were also found, which could potentially lead to maintenance issues in the future. Additionally, there were multiple instances where error handling was not properly implemented, leaving the application vulnerable to unexpected failures.",
        "fix_explanation": "To address these issues, the following approaches are recommended: Refactor the code to minimize the use of global variables and instead, pass variables as function arguments to improve testability and reduce unexpected side effects. Implement data validation for all user inputs to prevent SQL injection attacks and other forms of malicious input. Optimize database queries to improve performance and reduce server load. Adhere to PSR-12 coding standards to improve code readability and maintainability. Replace hard-coded values with configuration files or constants to make the code more flexible and easier to maintain. Lastly, implement proper error handling to ensure the application can gracefully handle unexpected failures and provide useful feedback to the user."
