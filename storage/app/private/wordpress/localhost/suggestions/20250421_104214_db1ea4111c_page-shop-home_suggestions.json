        "issue_details": "The analysis of the PHP file revealed several issues. Firstly, there were multiple instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities due to the lack of prepared statements or parameterized queries. Secondly, the code lacked proper error handling mechanisms, which could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. Thirdly, there were several instances of code redundancy, which could be simplified for better readability and maintainability. Lastly, the code did not adhere to PSR-12, the standard PHP coding style guide, leading to inconsistent code formatting and structure.",
        "fix_explanation": "To address the SQL injection vulnerabilities, all SQL queries should be rewritten to use prepared statements or parameterized queries. This will ensure that user input is properly sanitized before it is included in the SQL query. For the lack of error handling, appropriate try-catch blocks should be added around code that could potentially throw exceptions. This will allow the application to handle errors gracefully and prevent unexpected crashes. To reduce code redundancy, common code blocks should be extracted into separate functions or methods that can be reused. Finally, the entire codebase should be reformatted to adhere to the PSR-12 coding style guide. This will improve the readability and maintainability of the code."
