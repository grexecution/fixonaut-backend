        "issue_details": "The PHP file reviewed has multiple issues. These include: improper use of PHP tags, lack of proper indentation and code formatting which makes the code hard to read, use of deprecated PHP functions, SQL injection vulnerabilities due to lack of prepared statements, lack of comments for code clarity, and non-compliance with PSR-1 and PSR-2 PHP coding standards. Some variables are also not properly initialized before use, which can lead to unexpected behaviors. Error handling is not properly implemented, leading to potential crashes and unhandled exceptions. Lastly, there is a lack of modularization and use of functions, leading to code redundancy and inefficiency.",
        "fix_explanation": "The issues identified can be fixed by adhering to the following suggestions: Use of proper PHP tags and following a consistent indentation and code formatting style to improve code readability. Replace deprecated PHP functions with their newer counterparts. Prevent SQL injection by using prepared statements or parameterized queries. Add comments to explain the functionality of complex code blocks. Adhere to PSR-1 and PSR-2 PHP coding standards to ensure code quality and interoperability. Initialize variables before use to prevent undefined behaviors. Implement proper error handling mechanisms to prevent application crashes and handle exceptions gracefully. Lastly, modularize the code and make use of functions to avoid redundancy and improve code efficiency."
