        "issue_details": "The PHP file reviewed has several issues. These include improper use of global variables, lack of input sanitization, inefficient database queries, and poor error handling. There are also instances of code duplication, which could be refactored for better readability and maintainability. Additionally, the file lacks sufficient comments, making it difficult to understand the purpose of certain code blocks.",
        "fix_explanation": "To address these issues, we need to refactor the code. First, we should replace the global variables with local ones or pass them as function arguments to avoid potential conflicts. Next, we need to sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection and other security threats. We should also optimize the database queries to improve performance. Error handling should be improved by catching exceptions and providing meaningful error messages. Code duplication can be minimized by creating reusable functions or classes. Finally, adding comments to the code will make it easier to understand and maintain."
