        "issue_details": "The analysis of the PHP file revealed several issues. These include improper use of global variables, lack of input validation, inefficient database queries, and inconsistent code formatting. There were also instances of hard-coded values and a lack of error handling. The code also lacked sufficient comments, making it difficult to understand the purpose of some functions and blocks of code.",
        "fix_explanation": "To address these issues, we will first refactor the code to limit the use of global variables, replacing them with function arguments and return values where possible. We will implement input validation to prevent SQL injection and other potential security risks. The database queries will be optimized for efficiency, and hard-coded values will be replaced with constants or configuration options. We will also standardize the code formatting for readability and maintainability. Finally, we will add comprehensive comments to the code and implement robust error handling to make the code more resilient and easier to debug."
