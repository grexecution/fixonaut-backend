        "issue_details": "The PHP file reviewed contains several issues. These include: improper use of global variables, lack of proper error handling, inefficient database queries, and non-compliance with PSR-12 coding standards. Additionally, there are several instances of hard-coded values, which could lead to potential security vulnerabilities. The code also lacks proper comments, making it difficult to understand the functionality of certain sections.",
        "fix_explanation": "To address these issues, the global variables should be replaced with dependency injection or passed as parameters to functions. Proper error handling mechanisms should be implemented to prevent application crashes and provide meaningful error messages. The database queries should be optimized and prepared statements should be used to prevent SQL injection attacks. The code should be refactored to comply with PSR-12 coding standards for better readability and maintainability. Hard-coded values should be replaced with constants or configuration files. Finally, comments should be added to complex sections of the code to improve understandability."
