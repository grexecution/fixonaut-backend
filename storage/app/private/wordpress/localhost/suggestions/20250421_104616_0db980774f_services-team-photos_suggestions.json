        "issue_details": "The analysis of the PHP file revealed several issues. These include improper use of global variables, lack of proper input validation, non-adherence to PSR-12 coding standards, inefficient use of loops, and potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. There were also instances of hard-coded values, which should ideally be replaced with constants or configuration values. The code lacked sufficient comments, making it hard to understand the functionality of certain sections. Additionally, there were several instances of code duplication, indicating a need for refactoring and abstraction.",
        "fix_explanation": "The fix approach will involve multiple steps. First, we will refactor the code to avoid the use of global variables, replacing them with dependency injection where necessary. Input validation will be added where it is missing, to prevent potential security issues. The code will be reformatted to adhere to PSR-12 coding standards for better readability and maintainability. Loops will be optimized for better performance. Prepared statements will be used to mitigate the risk of SQL injection. Hard-coded values will be replaced with constants or configuration values for easier management and scalability. Comments will be added to clarify the functionality of complex code sections. Finally, code duplication will be addressed by abstracting common functionality into reusable functions or classes."
