        "issue_details": "The PHP file analyzed has multiple issues. The first issue is related to the improper use of PHP superglobals, which can lead to security vulnerabilities. The second issue is the lack of error handling, which can cause the application to crash or behave unpredictably in case of an error. The third issue is the use of deprecated functions, which can cause compatibility issues with newer versions of PHP. The fourth issue is the lack of code comments, which makes the code hard to understand and maintain. The fifth issue is the violation of coding standards, such as inconsistent indentation and naming conventions, which can make the code hard to read and understand.",
        "fix_explanation": "To fix the issues identified, the following steps should be taken. For the improper use of PHP superglobals, the code should be refactored to use safer methods, such as filter_input and filter_input_array. For the lack of error handling, try-catch blocks should be added around the code that can potentially throw an error. For the use of deprecated functions, the code should be updated to use the newer, recommended functions. For the lack of code comments, comments should be added to explain the purpose and functionality of the code. For the violation of coding standards, the code should be reformatted to follow a consistent coding style, such as PSR-12."
