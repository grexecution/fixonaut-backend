        "issue_details": "The analysis of the PHP file revealed several issues. The most significant problems include: improper use of global variables, lack of input validation which makes the code vulnerable to SQL injection, inefficient use of loops leading to performance issues, and non-compliance with PSR-1 and PSR-2 coding standards. Additionally, the code lacks proper error handling and does not follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, leading to code redundancy.",
        "fix_explanation": "To address these issues, the following approach will be taken: Global variables will be replaced with dependency injection or passed as function parameters to improve testability and maintainability. Input validation will be implemented using built-in PHP functions to prevent SQL injection. Loops will be optimized and unnecessary iterations will be removed to improve performance. The code will be refactored to comply with PSR-1 and PSR-2 coding standards to improve readability and maintainability. Proper error handling will be added to make the code more robust and easier to debug. Lastly, code redundancy will be eliminated by creating reusable functions and modules, adhering to the DRY principle."
