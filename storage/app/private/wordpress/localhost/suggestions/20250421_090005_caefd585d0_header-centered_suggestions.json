        "issue_details": "The analysis of the PHP file revealed several issues. Firstly, there were multiple instances of SQL Injection vulnerabilities due to the lack of prepared statements or parameterized queries. Secondly, the code lacked proper error handling mechanisms, which could lead to unexpected behaviors or crashes. Thirdly, there were redundant code blocks that could be refactored for efficiency and readability. Lastly, the code did not adhere to the PSR-12 coding standards, which is recommended for PHP development for consistency and interoperability.",
        "fix_explanation": "To fix the SQL Injection vulnerabilities, all SQL queries should be converted to prepared statements or parameterized queries. This will ensure that user inputs are not directly embedded in the query, thus preventing SQL Injection. For the error handling, try-catch blocks should be implemented where necessary, and meaningful error messages should be returned to the user. Redundant code blocks should be refactored into functions or methods, which can be called multiple times instead of repeating the same code. Finally, the code should be reformatted to adhere to the PSR-12 coding standards. This includes proper indentation, use of camelCase for variable names, and appropriate use of whitespace and line breaks."
