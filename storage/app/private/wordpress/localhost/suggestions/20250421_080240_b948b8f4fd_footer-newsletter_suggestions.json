        "issue_details": "The analysis of the PHP file revealed several issues. These include improper use of global variables, which can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs. The file also contains SQL queries that are not properly sanitized, making the application vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks. Additionally, there are instances of hard-coded values which should ideally be replaced with constants or configuration values. Finally, the file lacks proper error handling and debugging information, making it difficult to troubleshoot issues.",
        "fix_explanation": "To address these issues, we recommend the following steps. First, avoid using global variables and instead pass variables as function parameters or use dependency injection. This will make the code more predictable and easier to test. Second, sanitize all SQL queries to prevent SQL Injection attacks. This can be achieved by using prepared statements or parameterized queries. Third, replace hard-coded values with constants or configuration values to make the code more flexible and easier to maintain. Lastly, implement proper error handling and include debugging information in your error messages. This will make it easier to identify and fix issues in the future."
