        "issue_details": "The PHP file analyzed contained several issues. These include: improper use of global variables, lack of input validation leading to potential SQL injection vulnerabilities, inconsistent coding style, use of deprecated PHP functions, and lack of error handling. Additionally, the code lacks sufficient comments, making it difficult to understand the functionality of certain sections. Lastly, there are several instances of code redundancy that could be improved with more efficient programming practices.",
        "fix_explanation": "The fix approach will involve several steps. First, we will refactor the code to remove the use of global variables, replacing them with function parameters or class properties as appropriate. We will also implement input validation and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. The coding style will be made consistent throughout the file, adhering to PSR-12 coding standards. Deprecated functions will be replaced with their updated counterparts. Proper error handling will be introduced to ensure the application fails gracefully in case of unexpected issues. Comments will be added for better code readability and understanding. Finally, redundant code will be identified and refactored, potentially introducing new functions or classes to encapsulate common functionality."
