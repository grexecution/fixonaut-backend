        "issue_details": "The analysis of the PHP file revealed several issues. The main problems identified include: improper use of global variables, lack of input validation and sanitization, inefficient use of loops, and non-compliance with PSR-2 coding standards. Additionally, there were instances of hard-coded values, which could potentially lead to maintenance issues in the future. Lastly, the file lacked proper comments, making the code difficult to understand and maintain.",
        "fix_explanation": "The fix approach involves multiple steps. For the global variables, it is recommended to encapsulate them within classes as properties or pass them as parameters to functions. Input validation and sanitization can be improved by using built-in PHP functions or custom validation rules. Loop efficiency can be improved by using appropriate data structures or optimizing the loop conditions. To comply with PSR-2 coding standards, the code should be properly formatted and refactored. Hard-coded values should be replaced with constants or configuration values. Lastly, adding meaningful comments and properly documenting the code will make it more maintainable and understandable."
