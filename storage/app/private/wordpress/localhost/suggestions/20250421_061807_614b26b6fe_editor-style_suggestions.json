        "issue_details": "The CSS file review revealed several issues. These include the use of inline styles, which can lead to code redundancy and maintenance problems. There were also instances of important usage, which can create specificity issues and make debugging difficult. The file also contained unused CSS selectors, which can lead to unnecessary file size increase and slower page load times. Lastly, there were inconsistencies in indentation and spacing, which can make the code harder to read and understand.",
        "fix_explanation": "To address these issues, we recommend refactoring the CSS to remove inline styles and instead use external stylesheets for better reusability and maintainability. The use of !important should be avoided and replaced with better use of CSS specificity or by reordering the CSS declarations. Unused CSS selectors should be removed to improve performance. Lastly, a consistent code formatting standard should be adopted to improve code readability. Tools like CSS linters and formatters can be used to automate this process."
