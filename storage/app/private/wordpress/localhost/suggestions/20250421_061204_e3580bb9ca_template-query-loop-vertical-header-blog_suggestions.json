        "issue_details": "The PHP file reviewed has several issues. These include improper use of global variables, lack of input validation and sanitization, inefficient database queries, and poor error handling. There are also some instances of code redundancy and lack of adherence to PHP coding standards and best practices. The code lacks sufficient comments, making it difficult to understand the functionality of certain sections. Furthermore, the file does not have a consistent indentation style, making the code harder to read.",
        "fix_explanation": "To address these issues, the global variables should be replaced with dependency injection or passed as parameters to functions. All user inputs should be validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks. The database queries should be optimized and prepared statements should be used to prevent SQL injection. Error handling should be improved by using exceptions and custom error handlers. Redundant code should be refactored into reusable functions or classes. The code should be formatted according to PSR-1 and PSR-2 coding standards. Comments should be added to explain the functionality of the code. Lastly, a consistent indentation style should be adopted to improve code readability."
