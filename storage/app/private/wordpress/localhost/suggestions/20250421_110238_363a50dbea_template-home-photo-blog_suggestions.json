        "issue_details": "The PHP file analyzed has multiple issues. First, there are several instances of improper variable sanitization, which could lead to security vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection. Second, there are numerous instances of code redundancy, which makes the codebase larger and more difficult to maintain. Third, the file lacks proper error handling, which could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. Fourth, the code does not adhere to the PSR-2 coding style guide, making it less readable and maintainable. Lastly, there are several instances where deprecated functions are used, which could lead to compatibility issues in the future.",
        "fix_explanation": "To fix these issues, several steps need to be taken. For the improper variable sanitization, all variables should be properly sanitized before they are used in SQL queries to prevent SQL Injection. To address the code redundancy, the code should be refactored to remove duplicate code and functions should be created for tasks that are performed multiple times. Proper error handling should be implemented to ensure that the program can handle unexpected situations gracefully. The code should be reformatted to adhere to the PSR-2 coding style guide to improve readability and maintainability. Finally, all deprecated functions should be replaced with their newer counterparts to ensure future compatibility."
