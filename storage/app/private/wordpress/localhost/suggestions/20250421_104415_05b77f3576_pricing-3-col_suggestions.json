        "issue_details": "The analysis of the PHP file revealed several issues. These include: improper use of global variables, lack of input validation, inconsistent naming conventions, inefficient use of loops, and lack of error handling. Additionally, the code lacks proper commenting, making it difficult to understand the functionality of certain sections. There are also instances of hard-coded values, which makes the code less flexible and harder to maintain.",
        "fix_explanation": "To address these issues, we will need to refactor the code. This will involve: introducing local variables instead of using global ones, implementing input validation to prevent security vulnerabilities, and adopting a consistent naming convention to improve code readability. We will also optimize the loops to improve the code's efficiency and add comprehensive error handling to make the code more robust. To improve understandability, we will add comments explaining the functionality of complex code sections. Finally, we will replace hard-coded values with constants or configuration options, which will make the code easier to update and maintain."
