        "issue_details": "The analysis of the PHP file revealed several issues. These include: improper use of global variables, lack of input validation leading to potential security vulnerabilities, non-compliance with PSR-1 and PSR-2 coding standards, inefficient use of loops, and lack of proper error handling. Additionally, the code lacks sufficient comments, making it difficult to understand the functionality of certain sections.",
        "fix_explanation": "To address these issues, the following steps will be taken: Global variables will be replaced with dependency injection or passed parameters to improve testability and reduce the risk of unexpected side effects. Input validation will be implemented to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks. The code will be refactored to adhere to PSR-1 and PSR-2 coding standards, enhancing readability and maintainability. Loops will be optimized to reduce unnecessary iterations and improve performance. Proper error handling will be introduced to ensure that the application can gracefully handle unexpected situations. Finally, comments will be added to clarify the purpose and functionality of complex code sections."
