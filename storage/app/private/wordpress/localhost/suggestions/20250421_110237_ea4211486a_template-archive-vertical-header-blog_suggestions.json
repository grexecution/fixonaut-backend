        "issue_details": "The PHP file reviewed has several issues. These include: improper use of global variables, which can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs; lack of proper error handling, which can result in unhandled exceptions and crashes; inefficient database queries, which can slow down the application; and non-compliance with PSR-12 coding standards, which makes the code harder to read and maintain. Additionally, there are several instances of code duplication, which can make the codebase larger and more difficult to maintain.",
        "fix_explanation": "To fix these issues, we should first refactor the code to minimize the use of global variables, replacing them with dependency injection or class properties where appropriate. We should also add proper error handling to prevent the application from crashing in case of an error. The database queries should be optimized, possibly with the use of an ORM for better abstraction and performance. The code should be reformatted to comply with PSR-12 coding standards for better readability and maintainability. Lastly, we should remove code duplication by creating reusable functions or classes."
