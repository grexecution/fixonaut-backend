        "issue_details": "The PHP file reviewed had several issues. These included inconsistent indentation which makes the code hard to read, lack of comments which makes it difficult to understand the purpose of certain code blocks, use of deprecated functions which could lead to unexpected behavior, and potential SQL injection vulnerabilities due to the lack of prepared statements. Additionally, there were several instances where error handling was not properly implemented, which could lead to unexpected behavior in case of failure.",
        "fix_explanation": "To fix these issues, the code needs to be refactored. Indentation should be made consistent throughout the file to improve readability. Comments should be added to explain the purpose of each function and complex code blocks. Deprecated functions should be replaced with their newer, supported counterparts. To prevent SQL injection, all SQL queries should be implemented using prepared statements. Error handling should be added where it's missing, and existing error handling code should be reviewed to ensure it adequately handles all potential error situations."
