        "issue_details": "The php file analyzed has several issues. These include: improper use of global variables, lack of data sanitization leading to potential SQL injection vulnerabilities, improper error handling, and non-compliance with PSR-12 coding standards. There are also instances of hard-coded values, which could lead to difficulties in future code maintenance and scalability. Additionally, the code lacks sufficient comments, making it hard to understand the purpose of certain functions and blocks of code.",
        "fix_explanation": "To address these issues, global variables should be replaced with dependency injection or passed as function parameters to improve testability and reduce potential side effects. All user inputs should be sanitized and parameterized queries should be used to prevent SQL injection. Proper error handling mechanisms should be implemented to prevent application crashes and provide meaningful error messages. The code should be refactored to comply with PSR-12 coding standards for better readability and maintainability. Hard-coded values should be replaced with configuration files or constants. Lastly, adding comments to the code would make it easier to understand and maintain."
