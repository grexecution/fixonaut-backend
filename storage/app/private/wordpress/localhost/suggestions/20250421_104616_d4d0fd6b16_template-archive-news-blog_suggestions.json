        "issue_details": "The PHP file reviewed has several issues. First, there are multiple instances of SQL Injection vulnerabilities due to the direct use of user-supplied input in SQL queries. Second, there are several instances of code redundancy, where the same lines of code are repeated in different parts of the file. Third, the file lacks proper error handling mechanisms, which could lead to unexpected behaviors or crashes. Fourth, there are several instances of improper variable naming, making the code harder to read and understand. Lastly, the file lacks adequate comments, making it difficult to understand the purpose of certain code blocks.",
        "fix_explanation": "To fix the SQL Injection vulnerabilities, we need to use prepared statements or parameterized queries. This will ensure that user input is properly sanitized before it's used in a SQL query. To address the code redundancy, we need to identify common code blocks and move them into separate functions that can be called as needed. For the error handling, we need to add appropriate try-catch blocks to handle potential exceptions and prevent crashes. Improper variable naming can be fixed by renaming variables to more descriptive and meaningful names. Lastly, adding comments to explain the purpose and functionality of certain code blocks will make the code easier to understand and maintain."
