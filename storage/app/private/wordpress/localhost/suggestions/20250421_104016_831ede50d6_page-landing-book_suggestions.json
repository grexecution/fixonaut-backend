        "issue_details": "The PHP file reviewed exhibited several issues including improper use of global variables, lack of input validation, inefficient database queries, and poor error handling. The code also lacks proper commenting, making it difficult to understand the logic behind certain functions and operations. Furthermore, there are several instances of code redundancy which could be avoided with the use of functions or loops. Lastly, the code does not adhere to the PSR-1 and PSR-2 coding standards, which are widely accepted in the PHP community.",
        "fix_explanation": "The global variables should be replaced with dependency injection or passed as function arguments to improve testability and reduce coupling. All user inputs should be validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks. Database queries should be optimized, possibly through the use of prepared statements or stored procedures. Error handling should be improved by using exceptions and displaying user-friendly error messages. Comments should be added to explain the logic behind complex operations. Code redundancy can be eliminated by creating reusable functions or using loops. Lastly, the code should be refactored to follow the PSR-1 and PSR-2 coding standards for better readability and maintainability."
