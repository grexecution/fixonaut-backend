        "issue_details": "The CSS file reviewed has several issues. These include improper use of selectors, overuse of !important declarations, inconsistent indentation, lack of comments for complex code blocks, and non-responsive design. Some CSS properties are also deprecated and there are instances of duplicate rules. The file lacks a clear structure, making it hard to understand the relationship between different styles. Additionally, there are unused styles that need to be removed to improve performance.",
        "fix_explanation": "To resolve these issues, we will start by refactoring the CSS selectors to ensure they are used properly and efficiently. We will remove unnecessary !important declarations and replace them with more specific selectors. The code will be formatted for consistency, including proper indentation and spacing. Comments will be added to complex code blocks for better understanding. The CSS will be updated to ensure the design is responsive and works well on all devices. Deprecated properties will be replaced with their modern equivalents. Duplicate rules will be merged or removed as necessary. The file will be restructured for clarity and ease of maintenance. Finally, we will remove all unused styles to improve the performance of the CSS file."
