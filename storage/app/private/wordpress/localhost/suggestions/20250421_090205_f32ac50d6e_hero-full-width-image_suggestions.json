        "issue_details": "The PHP file reviewed had several issues. First, there were multiple instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities due to the lack of prepared statements or parameterized queries. Second, there were several instances of unhandled exceptions which could lead to application crashes. Third, there were numerous code blocks that lacked comments, making it difficult to understand the purpose of the code. Lastly, there were several instances of code redundancy which could be optimized for better performance and readability.",
        "fix_explanation": "To resolve the SQL injection vulnerabilities, all SQL queries should be converted to prepared statements or parameterized queries. For the unhandled exceptions, appropriate try-catch blocks should be added to ensure application stability. To improve code readability, comments should be added to all complex code blocks explaining their purpose and functionality. Lastly, to optimize the code, redundant code blocks should be refactored into reusable functions or methods."
