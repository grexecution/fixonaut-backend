        "issue_details": "The PHP file reviewed had several issues. These include improper use of global variables, lack of error handling, and inefficient database queries. The code also lacked proper commenting, making it difficult to understand the functionality of certain sections. Additionally, there were instances of hard-coded values, which could potentially lead to maintenance issues in the future. The file also had a few security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection risks due to the lack of sanitization of user inputs before using them in SQL queries.",
        "fix_explanation": "The global variables should be replaced with dependency injection or passed as function parameters to improve testability and maintainability. Error handling should be implemented to ensure the application can gracefully handle unexpected situations. The database queries should be optimized to improve performance. Comments should be added to clarify the functionality of complex code sections. Hard-coded values should be replaced with constants or configuration values to make the code more flexible and easier to maintain. Lastly, user inputs should be properly sanitized before they are used in SQL queries to prevent SQL injection attacks."
