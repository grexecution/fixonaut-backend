        "issue_details": "The PHP file analyzed has several issues. These include improper use of PHP syntax, lack of proper comments for better code understanding, inefficient use of loops, and non-adherence to PHP coding standards. There are also instances of hard-coded values, which make the code less flexible and harder to maintain. Some functions are overly complex, making them difficult to understand and prone to errors. Additionally, there are potential security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection due to lack of input sanitization and validation.",
        "fix_explanation": "The issues identified can be fixed by adhering to PHP best practices. Syntax errors can be corrected by following the correct PHP syntax. Code comments should be added for better understanding of the code. Loops can be optimized for better performance. Coding standards should be followed for better readability and maintainability. Hard-coded values should be replaced with constants or variables. Complex functions should be broken down into smaller, more manageable functions. To mitigate security risks, user inputs should be sanitized and validated before they are used in SQL queries."
