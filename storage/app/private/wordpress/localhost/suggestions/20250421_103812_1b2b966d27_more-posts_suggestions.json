        "issue_details": "The PHP file analysis revealed several issues. These include: improper use of global variables, lack of input validation leading to potential security vulnerabilities, inefficient database queries, and non-compliance with PSR-12 coding standards. There were also instances of hard-coded values, which could limit the flexibility and maintainability of the code. Lastly, the file lacked sufficient comments, making it difficult to understand the purpose and functionality of certain code blocks.",
        "fix_explanation": "To address these issues, the following steps will be taken: Global variables will be replaced with dependency injection or passed parameters to improve testability and reduce potential conflicts. Input validation will be added to prevent SQL injection and other forms of attacks. Database queries will be optimized to improve performance. The code will be refactored to comply with PSR-12 coding standards for better readability and maintainability. Hard-coded values will be replaced with configuration files or constants. Finally, comments will be added to clarify the purpose and functionality of the code blocks, making it easier for other developers to understand and maintain."
