        "issue_details": "The PHP file reviewed contains several issues. First, there are multiple instances of SQL Injection vulnerabilities due to the use of raw user input in SQL queries. Second, the code lacks proper error handling, leading to potential crashes or unexpected behavior. Third, there are several areas where the code does not adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, leading to unnecessary code duplication. Fourth, the code lacks proper comments, making it difficult to understand the functionality of certain sections. Lastly, there are several instances where deprecated PHP functions are used, which may lead to compatibility issues with newer PHP versions.",
        "fix_explanation": "To address the SQL Injection vulnerabilities, prepared statements should be used instead of concatenating user inputs directly into the SQL queries. For error handling, try-catch blocks should be implemented to catch exceptions and handle them gracefully. To adhere to the DRY principle, repeated code should be refactored into functions or methods which can be called multiple times. To improve code readability, comments should be added to explain the functionality of the code. Finally, deprecated functions should be replaced with their newer counterparts to ensure compatibility with newer PHP versions."
