        "issue_details": "The PHP file reviewed has several issues. Firstly, there are multiple instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities due to the lack of prepared statements or parameterized queries. Secondly, the code lacks proper error handling mechanisms, which could lead to unexpected behaviors or crashes. Thirdly, there are redundant lines of code and unused variables that could be cleaned up for better readability and performance. Lastly, the code does not adhere to PSR-12, the standard PHP coding style guide, resulting in inconsistent indentation and spacing, and improper naming conventions.",
        "fix_explanation": "To fix the SQL injection vulnerabilities, all SQL queries should be converted to prepared statements or parameterized queries. This will ensure that user input is never directly included in the SQL query string, eliminating the possibility of injection attacks. For error handling, try-catch blocks should be used to catch exceptions and handle them appropriately, rather than letting the program crash. Redundant code and unused variables should be removed to improve readability and performance. Lastly, the code should be reformatted to adhere to PSR-12. This will make the code easier to read and maintain, and will ensure consistency across the codebase."
